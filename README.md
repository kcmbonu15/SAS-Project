Statement of Problem
---------------------
A supermarket is offering a new line of organic products. The supermarket's management wants to determine which customers are likely to purchase these products.
The supermarket has a customer loyalty program. As an initial buyer incentive plan, the supermarket provided coupons for the organic products to all of the loyalty program participants and collected data that includes whether these customers purchased any of the organic products. Use the organics data set to do this investigation. The dependent variable is “TargetBuy”.


* Logistic Regression Stepwise Variable Selection Procedure Model A without log transformation
* Logistic Regression Stepwise Variable Selection Procedure Model B with log transformation

Classification Models used in Analysis:
---------------------------------------

1)	Logistic Regression   80% accuracy
2)	Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network) 81 % accuracy
3)	Random Forest  85% accuracy
  
* Conclusion: 
------------------
They were slight changes in the performance of the model the previous model behaved better than the transformed variables and still Random Forest give a better accuracy on both. And  therefore  log transformation did not do perform better in the model,.
My evaluation was focus on my validation data set
